#Virtual Personal Assistant (VPA) 🚀

A Virtual Personal  Assistant (VPA) is an AI-powered program that can perform tasks like speech recognition, answering questions, searching online, setting reminders, and more using voice commands or text inputs.

1 Features of a Virtual Assistant

A VPA can: ✅ Recognize speech 🎙 (convert spoken words to text)
✅ Respond with speech 🔊 (text-to-speech)
✅ Search the web 🌍 (Google, Wikipedia)
✅ Open applications & websites 🖥
✅ Tell the time & date ⏰
✅ Control system functions (shutdown, open files)
✅ Set alarms & reminders ⏳
✅ Send emails & messages 📧

2 How Does a Virtual Assistant Work?

A Virtual Assistant uses:
Speech Recognition → Converts user voice into text
Natural Language Processing (NLP) → Understands the user’s command
Task Execution → Performs the required action
Text-to-Speech (TTS) → Responds back to the user

Example Workflow:
🎤 User says: "What is Python?"
🔎 Assistant searches Wikipedia
📢 Assistant responds: "Python is a programming language..."

 3 Technologies Used

A Virtual Assistant is built using: | Component | Technology Used | |--------------|---------------------| | Speech Recognition | speech_recognition | | Text-to-Speech (TTS) | pyttsx3 | | Natural Language Processing (NLP) | NLTK, spaCy | | Search & Web Scraping | wikipedia, webbrowser, requests | | AI & ML (for Smart Responses) | OpenAI GPT, TensorFlow | | GUI (Optional) | Tkinter, PyQt |

4 How It Works

1️⃣ Listens to Your Voice using the microphone
